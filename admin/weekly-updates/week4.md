Overall Progress at the end of Week 3 (May 23 - 29)
  Client advised to shift our focus to noise filtering as the main aspect for this week.
  
- Try different filters to reduce the noise and match level with that of glucose analyte.
- Tried different filtering techniques
    - savgol filter - a low pass filter to reduce noise.
    - median filter - calculates average over the series.
    - Discrete wavelet transforms with different wavelets.
    - Butterworth filter- low pass filter.
