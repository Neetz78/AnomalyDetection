During this week, various functions were created in order to help characterise the clusters (see diagnostics.py script)
Also, all the notebooks were cleaned, the code commented, and blocks of descriptions were added in order to make them more easily useable by our client. 
We also made a glossary detailing all of the notebooks.
Finally, we had a code review on Friday, where our client got to run our code and explore the structure of the folder we had made available to them through their cloud.
They were impressed with the level of organiaztion in our notebooks.
