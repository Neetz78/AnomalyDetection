**Overall Progress at the end of Week 2 (May 9 - 15)
- Wrangled the data files, see the following code (one of our deliverables is to provide Siemens with pre-processsing scripts. Once our pipelines are further developed and we know what we want, we will turn the notebooks into scripts. 
  - Number of readings in the timeseries and the predictors match
    - SeparateLabels.ipynb
    - CheckMissingLables.ipynb
  - Removed columns that were not useful
    - Decided we are going to ignore the predictors for now. 
  - Standardized the waveforms and removed wet-up periods
     - exolore_time_series.ipynb
     - standardize.py
- Did lots of reading into whole time series clustering methodology. 
- Gained a better understanding of filtering
- Decided to start with all pin contacts and all unsuccessful readings
