* Need to include the hourly total in our weekly logs
* Make sure to verify the requirements for each weekly presentation on Canvas
* For the time series data, look into Fourier Transformation to decompose waveforms according to frequency (and not time) --> yields better results
* CNN could be a good idea to extract features after applying Fourier Transformations
* Think of the process less linearly, it will be very iterative, and will have to document as we go versus doing it all in one week
