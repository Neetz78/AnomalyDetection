# Agenda: To present our findings and ask questions and discuss
We presented our filtering techniques

# Questions ,  suggestions and comments:
Is savgol more sensitive to readings at the end?
Yes, they seem to be more sensitive than moving average

Look into convolution which is used for noise reduction which translates to extracting important features and then apply filter

Where are we going next ? 
- Convolution and clustering algorithms
- Compare our filtering results
- Find a better way to describe these clusters

Unsuccessful threshold - not too many pin contact in unsuccessful
