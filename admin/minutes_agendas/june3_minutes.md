**Weekly meeting with Siemens Healthineers, June 3rd 2022**
* Had a 20 minute meeting with our client to present them with the promising clusters we found. 
* They were very happy with the progress we've made.
* Justine brought up her concerns about scaling the timeseries and predictor file across the rows (for each timeseries). They were not overly concerned because the predictors were calculated using the raw timeseries and so they should be of the same magnitude. 
* Levannia mentionned that during the advisory committee it would be helpful to have metrics to characterise the waveforms so that we can compare the different clusters (i.e. number of pin contacts in each cluster, min, max)
* Levannia said we could send her the unsuccessful TestId that cluster with the pin contacts to get them verified by Olivia and check if they were misslabelled (will be doing today).
* We asked them if it would be useful for them to have a function that extracts the testids for the unsuccessful readings that were in the clusters that contained mostly pin contacts in order to verify if they were misslabelled. They said yes, but that it doesn't need to be anything fancy.
