*Summary of what was brought up during the meeting with the Capstone advisors*
- Apply fast fourier transforms and then extract features using a 1D CNN
- Look into Gaussian Mixtures (i.e what kind of covariance structure we used)
- Gaussian Mixtures might not be appropriate for time series model (even if applied to the features) - do not perform well in high dimensionality
- Read the paper that was shared to us by Debangsha (Unsupervised Learning for Multivariate Time Series)
- Since our research question and the expectations from our client has changed (after seeing that extracting the pin contacts might not be realistic), we should include an informal document in our repo with our proposal where we state what has changed and what are the current expectations.
