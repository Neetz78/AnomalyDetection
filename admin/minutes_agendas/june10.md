Today we had a 40 minute meeting with Levannia to show her our organized code. We went over:
* The glossary
* The SOM notebook
* The various functions in the diagnostic script
* Our skeleton for the final report
* Explaining the problem with plotting the centroid when using timeseries + predictors
* The new cluster we found using the autoencoder (300 pins, 100 unsuccessful)

Overall, she was impressed with how we had organized our folder. She noted that we had done a good job with all of our commenting.

When talking about our final report she noted that we could talk about the impact that other analytes can have on the one we were analyzing and how in the future, it could be good to find the pin contacts of that other analyte first.
