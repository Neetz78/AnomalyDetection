Minutes, meeting 2022-05-09 (30 minutes)

**Agenda : Presenting the proposal of the capstone problem**

**Presentation:**

 - The initial 15 minutes was spent on presentation.
 - The presentation consisted of :
   - About us (a brief introduction about our teammates)
   - Motivation
   - Proposal
   - Problem statement
   - Automation of finished good process (a brief overview of our plan of action of the project)
   - Data (the two different types of data we are working with, plots of data)
   - Schedule (The different phases of our project and timeline associated with it)
   - Deliverables
   - Team communication (how we are effectively communicating as a team)
   - Gannt chart
   - Questions
    
**Questions and comments from advisors and data scientists:**

**Questions:**

**Difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?**
 -  Mentioned about how supervised and unsupervised learning works and linked it to the problem statement 
      
**How do we plan on accommodating the different lengths of different signals?**
 -  We decided to try dynamic time warping to align two signals
    
**How does mixture model work?**
 -  Mixture model works by assigning probability of each data point being in a predicted cluster
    
**Where does feature selection portion of the project fall into?**
 -  The feature selection and engineering portion falls into the modelling phase of the project
    
**How do you plan to augment the data?**
 -  We plan to identify the time window which is important in time series data. This wimdow will be primarily focussed to generate similar waveforms.
    
 **Comments:**
 
**Comment on client generating more pin contact error data**
 -  The ratio of pin contact to successful readings (80:1 million) seemed very big and hence the client decided to generate more pin contact readings synthetically
