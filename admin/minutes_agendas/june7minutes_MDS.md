# Agenda : Presenting progress and getting feedback

We presented our findings to Irene and Debangsha:
- Different preprocessing steps 
  - centering waveforms around sample detection time
  - noise filtering
  - convolution
- Clustering algorithms 
  - Kmeans
  - Kshpae
  - SOM
  - Autoencoder

Questions asked:

- Did you try clustering with few clusters as elbow could be observed at 3?
  Yes, but it did not cluster out pincontact and unsuccessful properly

Feedback : More detailed explanation while presenting to avoid any knowledge gaps
