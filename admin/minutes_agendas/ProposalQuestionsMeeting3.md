**General discussion**

We will split into groups on two and each team will on one data, aggregate predictors and time series data. We were informed that the column fluid type was removed. Injection time is needed as we are conserding to drop out the wet-up period to remove the noise.Adtiya will retrieve these columns and send it over to us by tomorrow.Fluid types would result in two clusters.Was suggested to normalize the waveforms , so all the types of fluid looks the same and then clusters are formed based on errors and not fluid type.The amplitude is the one which causes the changes in the waveform else they are pretty much similar.
