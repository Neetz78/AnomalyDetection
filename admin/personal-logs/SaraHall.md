| May07 | 0.5     |    <ul><li>Divied up the slides for proposal presentation (30 mins)</li></ul>                                  |

| May09 | 8     |    <ul><li>1 hour exploring the new data </li><li> 1 hour – met with the group to prepare for advisory committee meeting proposal presentation and capstone proposal presentation</li><li> 30 mins – met with Siemens Healthineers advisory committee to give proposal presentation and get feedback </li><li>2.5 hours – did some wrangling to make sure test ids now match properly between the two data sources. Got rid of the pin contact records in the unsuccessful record files so they aren’t duplicated. <li>30 mins – Gave our proposal presentation to teaching staff and met as a group to discuss how it went after. We were a bit disgruntled by the discrepancies in instructions between the slides and Canvas</li></li>2.5 hours – literature review. Started with looking into waveform filtering but decided I need a better understanding of the field so I started reading about enzymatic amperometric biosensor readings. I’m hoping that will give me a stronger domain specific foundation. <li>Filled in my personal log (5 mins)</li></ul>                                        |
| May10 | 8     |     <ul><li>Read more on enzymatic biosensors for background info (2 hours) </li><li>	Met with the group a couple of times to try and organize ourselves better (1 hour)</li><li>	Tried (unsuccessfully) to find literature with what noise reduction strategies have been used for amperometric enzymatic bionsensors in the past (1 hour). </li><li> Explored the time series a bit more in depth. Discovered that between successful, unsuccesful, and pin contact have very different lengths and sample detection times. We will need to find a way to standardize and align.  (2 hours)</li><li>Looked into dynamic time warping, decided we need to figure out some way to normalize (1 hour) </li><li>Looked into normalization. We really need to deal with a lack of temporal alignment in our time series (1 hour) </li></ul>                                      |
