| May07 | 0.5     |    <ul><li>Divied up the slides for proposal presentation (30 mins)</li></ul>                                  |
| May08 | 1.5    |       <ul><li>Practiced fiving the proposal presentation (1.5 hours) </li></ul>                                      |
| May09 | 8     |    <ul><li>1 hour exploring the new data </li><li> 1 hour – met with the group to prepare for advisory committee meeting proposal presentation and capstone proposal presentation</li><li> 30 mins – met with Siemens Healthineers advisory committee to give proposal presentation and get feedback </li><li>2.5 hours – did some wrangling to make sure test ids now match properly between the two data sources. Got rid of the pin contact records in the unsuccessful record files so they aren’t duplicated. <li>30 mins – Gave our proposal presentation to teaching staff and met as a group to discuss how it went after. We were a bit disgruntled by the discrepancies in instructions between the slides and Canvas</li></li>2.5 hours – literature review. Started with looking into waveform filtering but decided I need a better understanding of the field so I started reading about enzymatic amperometric biosensor readings. I’m hoping that will give me a stronger domain specific foundation. <li>Filled in my personal log (5 mins)</li></ul>                                        |
| May10 | 8     |     <ul><li>Read more on enzymatic biosensors for background info (2 hours) </li><li>	Met with the group a couple of times to try and organize ourselves better (1 hour)</li><li>	Tried (unsuccessfully) to find literature with what noise reduction strategies have been used for amperometric enzymatic bionsensors in the past (1 hour). </li><li> Explored the time series a bit more in depth. Discovered that between successful, unsuccesful, and pin contact have very different lengths and sample detection times. We will need to find a way to standardize and align.  (2 hours)</li><li>Looked into dynamic time warping, decided we need to figure out some way to normalize (1 hour) </li><li>Looked into normalization. We really need to deal with a lack of temporal alignment in our time series. Also set up a virtual environment with appropriate packages on my computer. (1 hour) </li></ul>                                      |
| May11 | 8     |   <ul><li>Looked into the characteristic of the unsuccessful samples with `sample detection time` at 0.0. They account for around 28% of unsuccessful readings, and after looking at the waveforms, I’m pretty sure 0 indicates that the sample has not been detected, rather than sample detection occurring at 0. (1 hour) </li>  <li>Met with the group to discuss the progress we made yesterday and what we planned on doing today (1 hour).</li>   <li> Read a review paper on the unsupervised whole time-series clustering methods used between 2005 and 2015. Spent some time cross-referencing from their citations (2 hours)</li>   <li> Explained signal frequencies and the general ideas behind filtering and fourier transforms to Saisree and Justine (30 mins)</li>   <li> Played around with normalization/standardization of the waveforms to try and figure out a good way to window them. It looks like the periods leading up to and following sample detection will probably be useful. In terms of Fourier transforms, it might make sense to apply them on separated windows as the noise before/after sample detection differs quite a bit and we may not want to lose that temporal information. (3 hours)</li>   <li> Verified virtual environment versions and organized my local capstone folder structure (30 mins)</li> </ul>|
| May11 | 8     |  <ul> <li> Read through a really good PhD thesis on time series clustering [](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/268877028.pdf). They raise some really interesting points about dimensionality reduction, similarity measures, and preserving the information from the initial waveform. I think one of our machine learning pipelines should attempt to mimic their outlined process. (1.5 hours). </li><li> Played around with z-normalizing the time-series and aligning the reading so `SampleDetectTime` is considered time ‘0’. I’m still struggling to figure out how to deal with unsuccessful readings where the sample was never detected. In that regard, it might make more sense to leave time 0 as when the card was inserted into the reader. In that case though, we would need something like dynamic time warping to match the shape of the waveform further along when the sample is detected as this occurs at different times in different readings depending on when the sample was injected. (1 hour). </li><li> Did a bit more reading trying to track down papers similar to the PhD thesis then met with the group to discuss the progress that we’ve been making and brainstorm where to go next. (1.5 hours). </li><li> Found a bug in my initial wrangle notebook when separating pin contacts out from unsuccessful, tried to fix it. Then got an email that we had new data, so I had to re-run the wrangle code and fix it to work with the new data (3 hours). <\li><li> Pulled together some information about what I have accomplished this week to make communicating with Siemens tomorrow a bit easier. Met with the group to discuss (1 hour). <\li> <\ul>|
