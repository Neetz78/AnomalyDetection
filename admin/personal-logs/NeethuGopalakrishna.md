| Jun01 | 8     |<ul><li>Met with team members to prep before the client meeting [30 min]</li><li>Meeting with the client [1 hr]</li><li>Continued my work with the autoencoder, tried various ways to see how clusters are forming, with ust the featues extracted, performing PCA on the featues extracted, Had a hunch and decided to add the predictor file aggregate columns to see if it might add value. Perfomred EDA on the predictor file and obtained inmportant features from it Combined both the dataframe to form the final dataset and picked guassian mixture model as justine had good results perviously , Good! results found a cluster that had all the synthetic pins and few unsuccessful in it.Discussed this with team was suggested to try removing few other predctors dropped them and re-ran the model, Great the cluster now had Pincontacts, all of synthetic and containminated pincontacts and few of the unssucessful in them.[6 hr]</li><li>Updated daily logs[30 min]</li></ul>                                          |
